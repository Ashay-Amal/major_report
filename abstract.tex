This project presents a Neural Style Transfer system using CycleGAN (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks) to transform photographs into four artistic styles: One Piece anime, Disney animation, Studio Ghibli animation, and Van Gogh painting. The system transforms human faces into animated characters and landscapes into post-impressionist paintings using unpaired datasets with bidirectional mappings through cycle-consistency constraints.\\

The implementation includes dual generators and discriminators, adversarial loss for realistic generation, cycle-consistency loss for content preservation, identity loss for color preservation, and perceptual loss using VGG-19. A custom frame extraction algorithm using OpenCV creates animation datasets from video sources, while Van Gogh data combines landscapes and paintings from Kaggle.\\

Built with PyTorch 2.0 and CUDA acceleration, the system achieves inference times under 3 seconds per image on NVIDIA GPUs. The modular architecture enables extension to additional styles, and results demonstrate successful style capture while preserving semantic content.\\
